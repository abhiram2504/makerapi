# makerAPI

A React.js-based web application that fetches food recipes from the Edamam API. Use this app to explore a wide variety of recipes, filter them based on preferences, and get inspired for your next meal!

## Project Description

In this project, I learned about React.js and API integration. By building this app, I became familiar with:

- **React.js Hooks**: Utilizing `useState` and `useEffect` for managing state and side effects.
- **Asynchronous API calls**: Using `async`/`await` to fetch data from the Edamam API.
- **Core React concepts**: Working with JSX, components, props, and CSS modules.
